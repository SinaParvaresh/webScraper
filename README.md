## A subReddit stock title scraper

This program will scrape any subreddit set by the user, and return the top 5 most frequently mentioned stocks.

If not installed and on Windows, download from the Microsoft Store.

## After Installation

Create your own separate praw.ini file, where you will assign and store your reddit credentials such as the client ID, Client secret and your Reddit username/password.

Set the paramters of your SubReddit scraper such as the number of posts to go through, the particular subreddit (possibly another stock subreddit such as r/Investing or r/StockMarket).
